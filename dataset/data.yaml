# Dataset info (Temporal Split Strategy)
# Total images: 347
# Train: 217 images (62.5%)
# Validation: 90 images (26.0%)
# Test: 40 images (11.5%)
#
# TEMPORAL SPLIT to avoid data leakage:
# No adjacent frames in different splits
#
# TRAIN (Early temporal blocks):
# - video1: frames 1-12 (all 12 frames - table setup)
# - video2_1: frames 1-15 (early dish arrangement)  
# - video3_1: frames 1-30 (early eating phase)
# - video3_2: frames 1-70 (early finishing phase)
# - video4: frames 1-90 (early clearing phase)
#
# VALIDATION (Middle temporal blocks):
# - video2_1: frames 16-25 (late dish arrangement)
# - video3_1: frames 31-45 (middle eating phase)
# - video3_2: frames 71-100 (middle finishing phase)
# - video4: frames 91-125 (middle clearing phase)
#
# TEST (Late temporal blocks):
# - video3_1: frames 46-50 (late eating phase)
# - video3_2: frames 101-116 (guests leaving)
# - video4: frames 126-144 (final clearing)
